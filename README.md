## 1. Problem Statement 
  
  
### Functional Requirements

* The backend should receive the URL of the webpage being analyzed as a parameter. 


* After processing the results should be returned to the user. The result comprises the following information:

  ** What HTML version has the document?

  ** What is the page title?

  ** How many headings of what level are in the document?

  ** How many internal and external links are in the document? Are there any inaccessible links and how many?

** Did the page contain a login-form?

In case the URL given by the user is not reachable an error message should be sent as a response. The message should contain the HTTP status-code and some useful error description.

### Non-Functional Requirements:


The backend should cache the scraping results for each URL for 24 hours such that your backend does not have to redo the scraping for any given URL within the next 24 hours.

## 2. Steps towards building the solution


### Baby Steps

I had no prior experience of working with Django, so my first step was 
to quickly skim through some video tutorials on Django. This was followed by
going through the Django documentation thouroughly and implementing the steps.


### Problem Analysis

The problem basically asks us:

- Take input from the user
- If the url is present in the cache :
      *return the results by directing the user to a new page.
-else 
      *Hit the url and do the required analysis.
      
-  Redirect the user to the results page.


#### Step 1 :

Setup the machine to support django and python 3. Turns out, I got stuck in trivial issues with machine setup and it ended up consuming some time.


#### Step 2 : 

Creating  a model to store values in our database. This was followed by creating a super user and running migration scripts. This was followed by creating a form to get user input. This was fairly easy. I found it easy to navigate through the documentation and get the desired result.


#### Step 3 :

Creating the result view.
 








To run the web application, your system must fulfill the following requirements:

Django - 2.1.2


urllib3 - 1.23


beautifulsoup4 - 4.6.3


Python 3


Pip 3


Steps for setting up a virtual environment on your mac to run this code:

$ brew install python3


Pip3 is installed with Python3

Installation


To install virtualenv via pip run:

<pre> $ pip3 install virtualenv</pre>

<b>Usage</b>


Creation of virtualenv:

<pre>$ virtualenv -p python3 <desired-path></pre>
Activate the virtualenv:

<pre>$ source <desired-path>/bin/activate</pre>

Deactivate the virtualenv:

<pre>$ deactivate</pre>


After youâ€™ve created and activated a virtual environment, enter the command 

<pre>pip install Django</pre>

at the shell prompt/ terminal.

Now, move to the directory where you want to store the project


<pre> django-admin startproject webAnalyser</pre>
