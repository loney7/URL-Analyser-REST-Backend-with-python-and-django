<b> Problem Statement
  
  
## Functional Requirements

* The backend should receive the URL of the webpage being analyzed as a parameter. 


* After processing the results should be returned to the user. The result comprises the following information:

** What HTML version has the document?

** What is the page title?

** How many headings of what level are in the document?

** How many internal and external links are in the document? Are there any inaccessible links and how many?

** Did the page contain a login-form?

In case the URL given by the user is not reachable an error message should be sent as a response. The message should contain the HTTP status-code and some useful error description.

## Non-Functional Requirements:


The backend should cache the scraping results for each URL for 24 hours such that your backend does not have to redo the scraping for any given URL within the next 24 hours.





To run the web application, your system must fulfill the following requirements:

Django - 2.1.2


urllib3 - 1.23


beautifulsoup4 - 4.6.3


Python 3


Pip 3


Steps for setting up a virtual environment on your mac to run this code:

$ brew install python3


Pip3 is installed with Python3

Installation


To install virtualenv via pip run:

<pre> $ pip3 install virtualenv</pre>

<b>Usage</b>


Creation of virtualenv:

<pre>$ virtualenv -p python3 <desired-path></pre>
Activate the virtualenv:

<pre>$ source <desired-path>/bin/activate</pre>

Deactivate the virtualenv:

<pre>$ deactivate</pre>


After youâ€™ve created and activated a virtual environment, enter the command
